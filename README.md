# Code

BigNeuron uses Vaa3D (http://vaa3d.org and http://github.com/Vaa3D) as the major technical platform to port neuron tracing, analysis software tools, and other associated tools (e.g. data visualization and management, interaction with other tools, various analysis scripts in different languages, neuron modeling and simulation tools, data format, etc.) Interested people should check the Vaa3D project (http://github.com/Vaa3D) to access these Vaa3D-based BigNeuron code.

To access the source code of the neuron tracing algorithms, also check this page for detailed information of the algorithms and availability (https://github.com/BigNeuron/BigNeuron-Wiki/wiki/Neuron-Reconstruction-Algorithms).

This code repository includes only tools that are not directly impelmented in Vaa3D.
